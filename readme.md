## StoutLabs NextJS Site Starter

My new "site starter" template to get up and running with a new NextJS site in seconds.

### Built With:

- Preact
- NextJS
- Chakra UI
- Markdown w/ Frontmatter

### Also Included:

- Formik + Yup
- Framer Motion
- DayJS
- PrismJS (syntax highlighting)
- SCSS (currently just used for PrismJS, but it's easy to add more if needed. Use Chakra where possible, though!)
- ESLint + Prettier + VSCode configuration, including a JSconfig file.

## Instructions:

Download/clone files into a folder of your choice, and set up your own repo.

Hack away, have fun!
